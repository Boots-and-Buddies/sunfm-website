    answer:
      "Yes. A lot of my clients do a hybrid: mostly in-person, with online sessions when the schedule doesn't allow the drive. Online works best once we've established your form in-studio, so the default is to start with a few in-person sessions and flex into hybrid as needed.",

I've trained local restaurant owners, physical therapists, teachers, a few longtime Campbell residents who've been in the same house since the eighties, and a handful of tech folks who moved to Campbell specifically to get away from the intensity of Mountain View or Cupertino.",

          "What they want is honest, professional training that shows up the same way every session. Someone who doesn't talk down to them, doesn't push a sales agenda, and knows what they're doing with a barbell.

Most Campbell clients who've tried training before burned out because the trainer was pushing a bootcamp style, or the programming didn't account for real life.
